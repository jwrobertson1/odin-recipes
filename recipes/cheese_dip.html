    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar hot salsa</li>
            <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)</li>
            <li>3 large jalapeno peppers, chopped (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt processed cheese in a slow cooker on Low</li>
            <li>Cook and stir pork sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Mix sausage into processed cheese in the slow cooker. Stir in salsa, hot sauce, and jalapeño peppers.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low for 2 hours; serve hot.</li>
